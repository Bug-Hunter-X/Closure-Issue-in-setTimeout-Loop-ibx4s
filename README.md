This repository demonstrates a common closure issue in JavaScript when using `setTimeout` within a loop. The example shows how the variable `i` is not captured correctly in each iteration of the loop, resulting in all callbacks logging the final value of `i`. The solution shows how to use an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) to create a new scope for each iteration, capturing the correct value of `i`.
